Copyright of all Deliverables created while performing Services for the Client will be transferred to the Client, except in the cases described below.

7. **Indemnification/Liability**
	1. By Client. Client agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless Developer from any and all damages, liabilities, costs, losses or expenses arising out of any claim, demand, or action by a third party arising out of any breach of Client’s responsibilities or obligations, representations or warranties under this Agreement. Under such circumstances Developer shall promptly notify Client in writing of any claim or suit; (a) Client has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (b) Developer provides Client with commercially reasonable assistance, information and authority necessary to perform Client’s obligations under this section.

	2. By Developer. Developer agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless Client from any and all damages, liabilities, costs, losses or expenses (collectively “Liabilities”) arising out of any meritorious claim, demand, or action by a third party which is inconsistent with Developer’s representations and warranties made herein, except in the event any such Liabilities arise directly as a result of Client’s gross negligence or misconduct, provided that (a) Client promptly notifies Developer in writing of the claim; (b) Developer shall have sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (c) Client shall provide Developer with the assistance, information and authority necessary to perform Developer’s obligations under this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer shall have no obligation to defend or otherwise indemnify Client for any claim arising out of or due to Product, Third Party Materials, modifications of or content added to the Deliverables by Client or third parties, improper or illegal use of Deliverables, use of Deliverables not authorized under this Agreement, or the failure to update or maintain Deliverables.
	3. Settlement Approval. The indemnifying party may not enter into any settlement agreement without the indemnified party’s written consent.
	4. Limitation of Liability. The services and the work product of Developer are provided “as is.” In all circumstances, the maximum liability of Developer, its directors, officers, employees, design agents and affiliates, to Client for damages for any and all causes whatsoever, and Client’s maximum remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be limited to the total fee of Developer. In no event shall Developer be liable for any lost data or content, lost profits, business interruption or for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages arising out of or relating to the materials or the services provided by Developer, even if Developer has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and notwithstanding the failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.

8. **Term and Termination**
